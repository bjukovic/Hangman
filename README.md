# Hangman Game

This repository consists of three separate implementations of the classic Hangman game in C#, Python, and JavaScript. Each version offers a console-based game where players guess letters to reveal a hidden word within a limited number of attempts. This project demonstrates language-specific approaches to the same game logic, providing a great reference for multi-language programming.

## About the Game


**Hangman** is a word-guessing game where the program randomly selects a hidden word. The player attempts to guess it by entering letters, with each correct guess revealing the letter’s position(s) in the word. If a guessed letter is incorrect, an attempt is deducted. The game ends when the player either successfully guesses the word or runs out of attempts.

## Features

- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Playable in C#, Python, and JavaScript.
- **Console-based gameplay**: Simple and interactive game flow via the console.
- **Random word selection**: Each game session selects a new word from a predefined list.
- **Score tracking**: Monitors incorrect attempts and provides feedback.
- **Visual representation**: ASCII-based "hangman" figure to visually indicate progress.

## Implementations

Each version was developed and tested in **Visual Studio Code**, providing a consistent environment across all languages:

- **C#**: Developed as a .NET console application, ideal for cross-platform use.
- **Python**: Minimalistic, terminal-based version compatible with Python 3.x.
- **JavaScript**: A browser-based console game using JavaScript.   

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

## How to Play

1. The program will select a random word and display it as a series of underscores representing each letter.
2. Guess a letter by entering it into the console.
3. If the guessed letter is in the word, it will be revealed in its correct position(s).
4. If the letter is incorrect, an attempt is deducted. 
5. The game continues until you either guess the word correctly or run out of attempts.
