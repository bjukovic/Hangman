# Hangman Game

This repository contains implementations of the classic Hangman game in three different programming languages: **C#**, **Python**, and **JavaScript**. Each version provides a console-based game where players can guess letters to reveal a hidden word within a limited number of attempts.

## About the Game

Hangman is a word-guessing game. The program randomly selects a word, and the player attempts to guess it by suggesting letters. If the guessed letter is in the word, it is revealed in its correct positions. If not, the player loses one of their attempts. The game ends when the player successfully guesses the word or runs out of attempts.

## Features

- Multiple language implementations: C#, Python, JavaScript
- Console-based gameplay
- Word list for random word selection
- Score tracking and limit on incorrect attempts
- ASCII representation of the "hangman" for visual feedback on progress

## Languages

- **C#**: Console application developed using .NET, suitable for cross-platform play.
- **Python**: Simple, terminal-based version compatible with Python 3.x.
- **JavaScript**: A browser-based console game using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS (optional for basic UI).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- **C# version**: [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- **Python version**: [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **JavaScript version**: A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox)

### Installation

Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/hangman-game.git
cd hangman-game
```

#### C# (dotnet)

1. Navigate to the C# folder:
   ```bash
   cd CSharp
   ```
2. Build and run:
   ```bash
   dotnet build
   dotnet run
   ```

#### Python

1. Navigate to the Python folder:
   ```bash
   cd Python
   ```
2. Run the game:
   ```bash
   python hangman.py
   ```

#### JavaScript

1. Navigate to the JavaScript folder:
   ```bash
   cd JavaScript
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.

## How to Play

1. The program will select a random word and display it as a series of underscores representing each letter.
2. Guess a letter by entering it into the console.
3. If the guessed letter is in the word, it will be revealed in its correct position(s).
4. If the letter is incorrect, an attempt is deducted. 
5. The game continues until you either guess the word correctly or run out of attempts.
